/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is used to determine the needs of a new product. It is a process to determine the expectations"
const design = "Is a step to create and transform the users requirements into a suitable form "
const implemetation = "This is the time to implement what we had planned for. Its the time to code"
const testingIntegration = "This section is the time to test and function the code and get it to the user"
